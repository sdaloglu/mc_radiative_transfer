# Project: Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer

**Course**: PHY4905: Computational Physics  
**Semester**: Spring 2022  
**Author**: Sabahattin Mert Daloglu  

## Project Description

This project involves the implementation of a Monte Carlo simulation to model radiative transfer, a critical process in astrophysical phenomena. Radiative transfer describes the absorption, emission, and scattering of radiation in a medium, and Monte Carlo methods provide a statistical approach to model these processes.

The notebook provides step-by-step analysis and simulations to demonstrate the principles of radiative transfer using Monte Carlo techniques.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**  
   Overview of radiative transfer and its importance in computational physics and astrophysics.

2. **Monte Carlo Method**  
   Explanation of the Monte Carlo approach used to simulate the behavior of photons in a medium.

3. **Implementation**  
   Detailed explanation of the code and algorithms used to perform the radiative transfer simulations.

4. **Results and Discussion**  
   Visualization and analysis of the results obtained from the simulation, with insights into how different parameters affect the transfer of radiation.
